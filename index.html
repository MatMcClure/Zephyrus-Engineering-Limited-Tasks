  I used a link tag to connect the HTML to the CSS for some basic 
  stylization. I created a script tag for the JavaScript. I added an 
  event listener to the button to have the h1 change what it was 
  displaying. DOM manipulation was used with "getElementById" and
  "textContent" to grab the text by its ID and have its contents changed.
  A minor issue was when I changed the h1 text to a header instead of 
  keeping it in the body. This changed the formatting of my button. 
  To keep them aligned, I added ",header" beside my "body" in the CSS.
